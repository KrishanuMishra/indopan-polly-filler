                <p>In agriculture, a soil test is the analysis of a soil sample to determine nutrient and contaminated content, composition, and other characteristics such as the acidity or pH level. A soil test can determine fertility, or the expected growth potential of the soil which indicates nutrient deficiencies, potential toxicities from excessive fertility and inhibitions from the presence of non-essential trace minerals. The test is used to mimic the function of roots to assimilate minerals. The expected rate of growth is modeled by the Law of the Maximum.</p>

        <h1>Our Charges For Services</h1>
        <p>These all services with soil testing cost a farmer only Rs.800/- sample excluding service tax. The theory behind the charge is very simple Rs. 800/- is avg. cost of a DAP fertilizer 50 kg bag which is extensively used by farmer and is destroying soil nutrient, so if farmer paid us a Rs 800/- cost we will ensure that we save the cost of at least 5 bag of DAP, which will reduce his cultivation expenses and simultaneously save the soil nutrient and manage his total farming.</p>
