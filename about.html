        <h1>Market Potential & Competitive Advantage</h1>
        <p>Inorganic chemical fertilizer application on farms increased from very low levels to relatively high levels during the two to three decades. Increased fertilizer use greatly increased food and fiber production and helped raise the standard of living for all India. It was apparent well before the rapid expansion in fertilizer use that inexpensive ways to evaluate the fertility of a soil were needed to make more accurate fertilizer recommendations. During the expansion of fertilizer use, research on soil test development received considerable attention by POLYGON AGRO. They established soil testing laboratories, with the goals of implementing the new tests and educating farmers about the value of soil testing. Also during this time, commercial soil testing companies began to assist in serving the agricultural community. Commercial labs quickly became more numerous due to the success of soil testing.</p>
